✳️ SIGN UP SECTION:
if (isset($_POST['signUp'])) {
👉 This checks: Did the user click the "Sign Up" button?
(Meaning: Is there a form submission with a button named signUp?)




$firstName = $conn->real_escape_string($_POST['fName']);
$lastName = $conn->real_escape_string($_POST['lName']);
$email = $conn->real_escape_string($_POST['email']);
$password = md5($_POST['password']);
👉 These lines collect the input from the form:

$_POST['fName']: Gets the first name from the form.

$_POST['lName']: Gets the last name.

$_POST['email']: Gets the email.

$_POST['password']: Gets the password and converts it to a hashed format using md5() (note: not secure, we’ll fix that later).

👉 real_escape_string() is used to clean the data, to protect from SQL injection (a type of hacking).





$checkEmail = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='$email'";
$result = $conn->query($checkEmail);
👉 This checks if the email is already used:

It looks inside the user table in the database to see if there is already someone with that email.

$result will hold the outcome.








if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    echo "Email Address Already Exists!";
}
👉 If the query finds one or more users with that email:

It tells the user: "Email already exists" and stops.






else {
    $insertQuery = "INSERT INTO user (firstName, lastName, email, password)
                    VALUES ('$firstName', '$lastName', '$email', '$password')";
👉 If no one has used the email yet:

This line creates a command to save the new user into the database.







    if ($conn->query($insertQuery) === TRUE) {
        header("Location: index.php");
        exit();
    }
👉 If the saving is successful:

Redirect the user to index.php (usually a login or welcome page).

exit() makes sure the rest of the code doesn’t run after redirecting.







    else {
        echo "Error: " . $conn->error;
    }
}
👉 If the database insert fails for any reason:

Show the error to the user.








✳️ SIGN IN SECTION:


if (isset($_POST['signIn'])) {
👉 This checks: Did the user click the "Sign In" button?





$email = $conn->real_escape_string($_POST['email']);
$password = md5($_POST['password']);
👉 This collects the email and password from the form.
The password is again hashed using md5() to match the one saved in the database.




$sql = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='$email' AND password='$password'";
$result = $conn->query($sql);
👉 This searches the database:

For a user whose email and password match the one the user entered.







if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
👉 If a matching user is found:







    session_start();
👉 Start a session (a way to remember the user while they're on the website).





    $row = $result->fetch_assoc();
    $_SESSION['email'] = $row['email'];
👉 Save the user's email into a session so we can identify them on other pages.







    header("Location: homepage.php");
    exit();
👉 Send the user to the homepage after login is successful.





} else {
    echo "Incorrect Email or Password!";
}
👉 If login fails, show a message: “Incorrect Email or Password!”
