if (isset($_SESSION['email'])) {
Meaning:
This line checks if the user is logged in by verifying if their email is saved in the session.

$_SESSION['email']: This is like a temporary variable that stores the user's email after they log in.

isset(...): This checks if it exists.

If the email exists, then the user is considered logged in and the code inside the {} will run.





$email = $_SESSION['email'];
Meaning:
This line saves the email from the session into a new variable called $email, so we can easily use it later.





$query = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='$email'");
Meaning:
This line runs a MySQL query to get the user’s data from the database.

mysqli_query(...): This sends a query to the database.

$conn: This is the connection to the database (already created elsewhere).

"SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='$email'": This asks the database to get everything ( * ) from the user table where the email matches the one from the session.

So in plain English:

"Look in the user table and find the person whose email is this one."





while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($query)) {
Meaning:
This goes through each result returned from the database.

mysqli_fetch_array($query): This gets one row of data from the query results (e.g., firstName, lastName, etc.).

while (...): Even though there should only be one match (because emails are usually unique), we use a loop to handle the result.

So this line says:

"For each row we got from the database, do the following..."







echo $row['firstName'] . ' ' . $row['lastName'];
Meaning:
This line displays the user’s first and last name.

$row['firstName']: Gets the value of the firstName column from the row.

$row['lastName']: Gets the value of the lastName column.

.: This is used to join text in PHP.

' ' adds a space between the first and last name.

So it prints something like:
"John Doe"
